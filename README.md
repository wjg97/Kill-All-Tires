# Kill-All-Tires

## Summary: 
As an avid car enthusiast
I want a one-stop shop to be able to get all the important services done on my vehicle
so that I can spend more time burning tires.
Given a login screen, I am able to sign up and login into an account
Then I am presented with available services
When I click on a given service I am presented with the price, details about the service, and an input box to enter my vehicles information
Then, when I have a service and vehicle selected I am able to checkout and send a request to the mechanic shop
